// These exist because the two apps quietly disagreed.
//
// The Congregant app wrote 'Mume'/'Mke' for jinsia while this app counted only
// 'Mwanaume'/'Mwanamke'. A member filling in their gender was saved perfectly —
// and then counted as nothing: the Wanaume/Wanawake totals at the top of
// Washiriki never moved, and no gender chip appeared on their row. Nothing
// errored, so nothing pointed at the cause.
//
// Hali ya Ndoa had the identical split ('Mseja' here vs 'single' there) and was
// one stat bar away from reproducing the whole bug.
//
// One list, deliberately duplicated into both apps (separate bundles, no shared
// package). If you change it here, change Congregant/src/lib/memberFields.ts
// AND the conversion block in database/schema.sql — otherwise old rows keep the
// old spelling and stop matching.
